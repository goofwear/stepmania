// Test file for Miryo's new Unlock system. 
// Songs are matched by name, not folder name
//
// System modified by curewater
//
// The following methods are implemented:
//
// [DP] - Dance points, e.g. 2 per perfect, 1 per great, etc.
//    [DP]5000 would require 5000 dance points to unlock.
//
// [AP] - Arcade points, like MAX2 arcade
//    [AP]5000 would require 5000 arcade points to unlock.
//
// [SP] - Song points, like MAX2 Home
//    [SP]1000 would require 1000 song points to unlock.
//
// [CS] - Clear Stages, like 5th Home
//    [CS]100 would mean you have to clear 100 stages to unlock.
//
// [RO] - Roulette, unlocked by landing on it in roulette.
//    [RO]5 means the song is part of 'slot' 5.
//
// To be implemented: Toasty, Clear Extra Stages, Fail Extra Stages.
//
// Courses will be implemented eventually, but not yet.
// Songs are matched by title + subtitle.
