BUILD
The build process has been revised a little bit.
1. Download StepMania Libs.tgz from:
http://cs.washington.edu/homes/steve/sm/StepMania_Libs.tgz
2. Decompress and install `StepMania_Libs.tgz' using Install.app.
3. Build StepMania by running `pbxbuild' in the PBProject directory.


NOTES
1. `StepMania Libs.pkg' is the same package that the users will be installing
to run StepMania.

2. The `StepMania Libs.pkg' can be generated by running the 
`copy_files_for_libs.sh' script. This requires that the latest versions of SDL,
SDL_image, libogg, libmad, libvorbis, libjpeg, libpng, and zlib be installed in
/usr/local. This can be done by downloading:
*FINISH ME* get the list of URLs. *FINISH ME*
and installing them using the GNU build system.
Then, open `StepMania.pmsp' with PackageMaker, change the root path as outlined
in `copy_files_for_libs.sh' and create the package.
