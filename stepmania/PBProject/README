REQUIREMENTS
Mac OS X 10.4 or higher is required. The Mac OS X 10.2.8 SDK needs to be
installed.

Xcode 2.2.1 is required to build.

BUILD
1. Open Xcode project file
2. Build.  (be sure to change to the Universal configuration before release)

INSTALL
To build an Installer package, run scripts/mkrelease.pl. It takes one
optional argument which should probably be a date. For example
$ scripts/mkrelease.pl
will produce StepMania-4.0-beta4.pkg if ProductInfo.h defines the
version to be "4.0 beta4".
$ scripts/mkrelease.pl 20060507
will produce StepMania-CVS-20060507.pkg for CVS releases
