REQUIREMENTS
Mac OS X 10.4 or higher is required. The Mac OS X 10.2.8 SDK needs to be
installed.

Xcode 2.2.1 is required to build. Even though the stepmania project
appears to be a ProjectBuilder project, it has been updated by XCode and
no longer works with ProjectBuilder.

BUILD
1. Download StepMania from sourceforge.
2. Cd to the PBProject directory enter: $ touch ver.cpp
3. Cd to Frameworks and unpack Frameworks.tar.bz2 by:
$ tar jxf Frameworks.tar.bz2
4. Build StepMania by running:
$ xcodebuild -target stepmania -configuration Native
in the PBProject directory.
To build a universal binary instead, use "-configuration Universal"
instead of "-configuration Native"
5. (Optional) Run:
$ strip -x StepMania.app/Contents/MacOS/StepMania
to reduce the size of the binary.

INSTALL
To build an Installer package, run scripts/mkrelease.pl. It takes one
optional argument which should probably be a date. For example
$ scripts/mkrelease.pl
will produce StepMania-4.0-beta4.pkg if ProductInfo.h defines the
version to be "4.0 beta4".
$ scripts/mkrelease.pl 20060507
will produce StepMania-CVS-20060507.pkg for CVS releases
