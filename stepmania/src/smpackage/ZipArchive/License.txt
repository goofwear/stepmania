Distributing ZipArchive under GNU GPL implies ZipArchive can only be used 
with software that is licensed under conditions compliant with the GPL. 
Embedding in proprietary software requires an alternative license.
</B></EM>

\subsection s1 Alternative license for use with proprietary software


If you want to distribute software in a commercial context that incorporates
ZipArchive and you do not want to meet the conditions of GNU GPL 
<B>(e.g. an obligation to provide a customer with the source code of your 
software that uses the ZipArchive library)</B>, you need to have a commercial license. 
- The commercial license provides you with the same rights as the GNU GPL, but in 
addition allows you to embed ZipArchive library in proprietary software without 
affecting the copyright of this software (it removes the GNU GPL obligation 
to publish the source code)
- The license does not allow you to transfer these rights
- The license is granted per developer or per company
- It does not depend on the amount of copies of software that uses the library sold
- You won't need to purchase an additional license for the future versions of the library


The commercial license is available free of charge for freeware and shareware
programs. If your program is distributed in a similar way to the one of the 
above, the commercial license will be granted to you free of charge as well.
<BR>
There is a fee for the commercial license for using the library in the software 
not falling into the mentioned categories.
<BR>
It is recommended that you should print two copies of the commercial license 
document after you receive it, sign them and send by post. One copy, signed by the author will be sent back to you.
