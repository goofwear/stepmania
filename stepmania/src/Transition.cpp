 * XXX: We send OnCommand on load, then we send no updates until we get

 * that commands can have arbitrary side-effects.  We should only send OnCommand
 * when we get StartTransitioning, but we need to run it early to set m_fLengthSeconds.
 * Eventually, phase out GetLengthSeconds (ScreenGameplay is somewhat tricky).  For
 * now, play a "StartTransitioning" command; put anything that has side-effects in
 * there, instead.
