// Last Updated February 21th, 2003

Todo List:
  ** Find a way to get the length of a movie being played, so ScreenIntroMovie does not have to have a pre-determined length (I.e: exits when the movie is finished playing)
  ** Adding support for "BEGINNER HELP".. The thing that has a character showing where to step during the song, only on beginner mode. IE: Replaces the BG with this dynamic image sequence, showing what arrow to hit as it comes up on screen. You can see this in the BG of a DDRExtreme song if you pick "beginner" difficulty.


Done as of 02/21/03:
    NEW FEATURE** New screen added, for DDREx style difficulty selection. This is optional in the APPEARANCE OPTIONS menu

    NEW FEATURE** Added screen to allow adjustment of Stepmania's internal volume, ScreenSoundOptions

Done as of 02/12/03:
    NEW FEATURE** Added 12x speed mod for the hell of it ^_^
    NEW FEATURE** Song Options menu (2nd screen after entering options on song selection), can be enabled or disabled. This is in MACHINE OPTIONS

         CHANGE** Coin mode can be changed instantly, without a reset, at any screen with F3.
  FEATURE FIXED** Operator & InsertCoin keys are no longer static, and are now configurable AND global. Also, Operator key -only- works outside of the edit system & options screens.. This saves hassles of "oops, hit the operator key, my edit is gone!"
     FILE FIXED** For some reason, ScreenIntroMovie.h never made it into the project workspace.. fixed :-p

    NEW ELEMENT** Joint Premium banner on the SelectStyle screen, as in DDRMAX2
    NEW ELEMENT** Joint Premium scrolling msg banner on TitleScreen as in DDRMAX2
  ARCADE-MIRROR** Selecting "RANDOM", now chooses the song FOR you, almost like DDREX does (ddrex just fades out and doesn't tell you what song it picked)
