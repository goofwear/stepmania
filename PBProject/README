REQUIREMENTS
Mac OS X 10.4 or higher is required. The Mac OS X 10.2.8 SDK needs to be
installed.

XCode 2.2.1 is required to build. Even though the stepmania project
appears to be a ProjectBuilder project, it has been updated by XCode and
no longer works with ProjectBuilder.

BUILD
The build process has been revised yet again.
1. Download StepMania from sourceforge.
2. Cd to the PBProject directory enter: $ touch ver.cpp
3. Cd to Frameworks and unpack Frameworks.tar.bz2 by:
$ tar jxf Frameworks.tar.bz2
4. Build StepMania by running:
$ xcodebuild -target stepmania -configuration Native
in the PBProject directory.
To build a universal binary instead, use "-configuration Universal"
instead of "-configuration Native"
5. (Optional) Run:
$ strip -x StepMania.app/Contents/MacOS/StepMania
to reduce the size of the binary.
INSTALL
From the PBProject directory, run:
$ scripts/mkrelease.pl .. <version>
Build a package using the PackageMaker project stepmania.pmproj.
