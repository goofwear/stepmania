REQUIREMENTS
Mac OS X 10.3 or higher is required. The Mac OS X 10.2.7 SDK needs to be
installed. (See NOTE.)
XCode is required to build. Even though the stepmania project appears to
be a ProjectBuilder project, it has been updated by XCode and no longer
works with ProjectBuilder.

BUILD
The build process has been revised yet again.
1. Download StepMania from sourceforge.
2. Cd to the PBProject directory enter: $ touch ver.cpp
3. Cd to Frameworks and unpack Frameworks.tgz by: $ tar zxf Frameworks.tgz
4. Build StepMania by running `xcodebuild -target stepmania' in the PBProject 
directory.

INSTALL
Build the installer, from the PBProject directory, run:
$ xcodebuild -target BuildInstaller -target Installer
Now copy the StepMania.app application from build to stepmania via:
$ cp -r build/StepMania.app ..
Next cd to the build directory and run the command:
$ ./BuildInstaller ../scripts/installer.config Installer.app/Contents/Resources
And at the prompt enter: ../..
Now Installer.app is ready to be distributed.

NOTE
I added the symlink:
ln -s /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A/Libraries \
/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.2.7.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenGL.framework/Versions/A
because Apple was stupid and screwed up that framework in all of the SDKs.
