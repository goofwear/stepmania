extra:
dlcompat from:
http://www.opendarwin.org/projects/dlcompat/

SDL-1.2.7
ffmpeg-0.4.8
jpeg-6b
libmad-0.1.5.1b
libogg-1.1
libpng-1.2.5
libvorbis-1.0.1
lua-5.0

Directions:
0. Make and install dlcompat using
	autoreconf && ./configure && make && make install
1. Decompress all of those in the Libraries directory.
2. Some of these need to have ./configure run before they will build. I know
that ffmpeg does. Others might as well.
3. Build frameworks from those libraries using xcode.
4. Hope I haven't missed anything else...


TODO:
Get prebinding to work correctly with all of these. dlcompat is not built
prebound by default so ffmpeg cannot be prebound so StepMania cannot be
prebound. Furthermore, libvorbis depends on libogg (or is it the other way
around) and some a symlink needs to be made. I made some script for this, but
for some reason that I do not recall, nor do I care to look into at this time,
it did not work correctly.
