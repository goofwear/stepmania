Frameworks:
ffmpeg-0.4.9-pre1
libmad-0.1.5.1b
libresample

Static Libraries:
jpeg-6b
libogg-1.1
libpng-1.2.7
libvorbis-1.0.1
lua-5.0

Directions:
1. Decompress all of those in the Libraries directory (libresample can be
copied from stepmania/src/libresample).
1.5. Patch ffmpeg using ffmpeg-0.4.9-pre1-sm.patch.
2. Some of these need to have ./configure run before they will build. I know
that ffmpeg does. Others might as well. ffmpeg's configure needs to be run as
./configure --disable-vhook
3. Build the frameworks listed above from those libraries using Xcode 2.2.1.
4. Build static libraries with ./configure && make of the static libraries
and move them into the Libraries directory.
