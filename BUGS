These are all minor bugs and bugs that are either annoying or difficult
to fix.  One purpose of this file is to allow bored developers looking for
something to do a quick list of minor outstanding bugs.  So, if you're
adding something here, try to either 1: make sure it's really a bug, or
2: if it's unconfirmed or unreproducable, say so.  Try not to put subjective
things here, like cosmetic differences that some people don't like (unless
they're actually bugs).

This isn't intended as a replacement for the SF BTS; once we clean that
up and start using it, we might drop this file.

For more minor bugs, grep for "XXX" in the source (but not all of
those are bugs).  Some of those might be duplicated here.

Major bugs are usually either fixed or discussed on the list, so this
list only has minor bugs.


--------

Many menu screens don't tween completely offscreen if a selection is made
before the tween-in finishes.  Easy to fix: don't tween from current loc to
eg. current loc+screen width; always tween to the real dest loc+screen
width.

Selecting in a second player on the select style screen changes the
available options.  If you do that while it's tweening in, the dims
will be adjusted as if there was no tweens; the net result is the change
is wiped out as the tween finishes.  Changing tweenable properties that
have nothing to do with the current tween (eg. here, changing the dim
while we're tweening X,Y) is tricky right now; I'm not sure how to handle
this cleanly ...

Doubles is misaligned if the second player side is selected first.
