1. About StepMania
************************************************************

StepMania game system is capable of playing many game types.  Currently, it 
supports games Dance Dance Revolution and Pump It Up, with future support for EZ 
2 Dancer, BeatMania, Guitar Freaks, DrumMania, Para Para Paradise and more.


************************************************************
2. Minimum Requirements
************************************************************

* Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows 2000, or Windows XP
* Pentium II, Pentium III, Celeron, Athlon, or compatible processor, 266MHz 
  minimum (400 MHz highly recommended)
* 64 MB of RAM
* Video card that supports High Color (16-bit color) and has 16MB video RAM
* DirectX 8.1 compatible video card with drivers
* DirectX 8.1 compatible sound card with drivers
* DivX 5 video codec (for movie visualizations)


************************************************************
3. DirectX
************************************************************

DirectX 8.1 is required before installing StepMania. If DirectX 8.1 is not 
installed on your computer, the StepMania installer will display a warning 
and abort the installation.


************************************************************
4. Installation
************************************************************

To install StepMania, download the file stepmania3.exe to a known location 
on your hard drive, then double-click the file icon to begin the installation.
The installer automatically remove an older version of the program if one is 
present. The default installation directory is 'C:\Program Files\StepMania'.


************************************************************
5. Controls
************************************************************

Use the "Config Key/Joy" option from the Title Menu to configure your 
keyboad, dance pad, or other game controller.

The following is a list of special keys.

Any time:
  * F4 = toggle fullscreen
  * F5 = toggle detail
  * Tab = increase game speed 4x (useful for moving through menus quickly)
  * LShift = decrease game speed to 1/4x

In menus:
  * Arrow keys navigate menus
  * Enter = Start, Escape = Back

In gameplay:
  * F8  = toggle AutoPlay
  * F9  = decrease offset
  * F10 = increase offset
  * F11 = decrease BPM of current segment
  * F12 = increase BPM of current segment
  * Hold Escape = abort playing


************************************************************
6. How StepMania Loads Songs
************************************************************

All song files for a specific song (data file, music file, banner, background) 
must reside in a single folder.  This folder must have the following path:

   Songs/<group folder>/<song folder>/

For example, the song B4U may consist of the following files:

   Songs/Dance Dance Revolution 4th Mix/B4U/b4u.dwi
   Songs/Dance Dance Revolution 4th Mix/B4U/b4u.mp3
   Songs/Dance Dance Revolution 4th Mix/B4U/b4u-banner.png
   Songs/Dance Dance Revolution 4th Mix/B4U/b4u.png
   Songs/Dance Dance Revolution 4th Mix/B4U/b4u-movie.avi

StepMania supports the SM, DWI, BMS, and KSF song file formats.

If a song file does not specify a valid banner file, StepMania first looks 
for a graphic in the song folder that contains the letters "banner".  If that
search fails, StepMania will guess which image is most appropriate.

If a song file does not specify a valid background file, StepMania first looks 
for a graphic in the song folder that contains the letters "bg" or "background".
If that search fails, StepMania will guess which image is most appropriate.

If a song file does not specify a valid CDTitle file, StepMania will look
for a graphic in the song folder that contains the letters "cdtitle".  If that 
search fails, StepMania will guess which image is most appropriate.

Also, for compatibility with DWI, if can reading CDTitles from the .\CDTitles 
folder.  Song makers are not encouraged to not use this feature and instead 
should put the CDTitle graphic in the song folder.  Having a separate CDTitles 
folder breaks the principle that all files needed to play a song should reside 
in the song folder.

If a song file does not specify a valid movie background file, StepMania will 
look for a movie in the song folder that contains the letters "movie".  If 
that search fails, StepMania will use the first movie in the song folder.


************************************************************
7. Connecting Dance Pads
************************************************************

There are several devices that allow you to connect PlayStation dance pads to 
your PC.

* Not recommended:  generic PlayStation->USB converter 

Using a generic PlayStation->USB converter is not recommended to play any 
dancing game on the PC.  The vast majority of these converters are not capable 
of registering simultaneous presses of Left+Right or Up+Down.  This 
restriction will cause the player to miss many notes where two buttons must 
be hit simultaneously.

* Highly Recommended:  Special PlayStation->USB adaptor

There is just one brand of PlayStation->USB adaptor that functions perfectly 
with StepMania.  These adaptors are available for purchase at the StepMania 
web site (www.stepmania.com) and through some importers (www.liksang.com).  
The adaptor is made by "Boom", and it small and black with a detachable USB 
cable.  These adaptors cost about $15 and allow you to attach one dance pad 
per adaptor.  The primary advantage of these adaptors is that they do not 
require special drivers and require no configuring.

* Semi-Recommended:  PlayStation->Parallel adaptor

PlayStation->Parallel converters do not have the simultaneous button problem 
that USB converters do.  The disadvantage of these adaptors is that home-made 
drivers are required to use these devices.  These drivers are often finicky 
and incompatible with some sound cards.  PlayStation->Parallel adaptors can 
be purchased from the StepMania web site or any importer.

For Windows 98 and Windows Me users, the recommended driver is "DirectPad Pro 
5.0 for Win9x".  For Windows 2000 and Windows XP, the recommended drivers are 
NTPad XP 1.x.  Both of these drivers can be downloaded from Aldos web site: 
http://www.aldostools.com/dpad.html


************************************************************
8. Compatibility Issues
************************************************************

Some video card/driver combinations have visual errors when running StepMania. 
If you experience any visual errors, please visit your video card manufacturer's 
web site and download the latest Direct3D 8.1 drivers. Below is a list of known 
issues that are thought to be video card driver bugs:

* S3 Savage family cards (e.g. Diamond Stealth)
Symptom: The right edge of some graphics appears "cut off".
Explanation: Drivers do not properly handle textures >= 512x512, resulting in 
cropped textures. Turn the texture detail option to 256 to force textures to 
a smaller size.

* SiS cards 
Symptom: Garbled fonts.
Explanation: Drivers have errors in handling texture coordinates. Only known 
solution is to upgrade drivers.

* Any card older than two years
Symptom: Various graphical glitches.
Explanation: These problems are most often caused by buggy video card drivers
bugs.  Please upgrade to the latest drivers, which will hopefully fix the 
errors.


************************************************************
9. FAQ / Troubleshooting
************************************************************

* The error "Cannot find Dinput8.dll" appears when launching the game.

You need to download DirectX 8.1.  http://www.microsoft.com/directx

* StepMania reports "Direct3DCreate failed".

You need to download DirectX 8.1.  http://www.microsoft.com/directx

* StepMania reports "Direct3DCreateDevice failed".

This error means that your video card or drivers do not support Direct3D 8.  
Download the latest drivers for your video card.  If your video card is older 
than 2 or 3 years, Direct3D 8 drivers may not be available.  Sorry.

* Music rates of over 100% do not work on my computer. Why?

Some very old sound cards do not support sound playback rates that are greater 
than the original sample rate.  This problem is likely to be corrected by newer 
sound card drivers.

* Im looking to purchase a video card.  What works well with StepMania?

Just about any video card manufactured in the last year will run StepMania 
flawlessly at 60 frames per second.  I recommend any card with an nVidia 
GeForce chip or an ATI Radeon chip.

* How can I improve performance with my existing video card

1. Install the latest drivers for your video card.
2. Press F5 in the game to toggle between high detail and low detail modes.
3. Tweak the Display Resolution and Texture Resolution setting in the GameOptions 
   screen.

* Chris, will you tell me when the next version will be released?

I'd rather not going to say.  Sorry.  It's gotten me in trouble before.

* Why won't you tell me?  I promise I won't tell anyone else.

The reason I won't tell is because: a) I don't know yet, and b) I don't want 
to make  anyone angry if it takes longer than I expect (it usually does).


************************************************************
10. StepMania Packages - .smzip
************************************************************

The StepMania package format was created to make the distribution of songs and 
other add-ons very easy.  StepMania package files have the extension '.smzip' 
and can be installed by double-clicking the .smzip file.

A StepMania package is 'installed' by extracting all files in the package to the 
StepMania program directory. This allows songs, courses, themes, and 
visualizations to all be installed by the Package Manager.

The file format of an .smzip file is actually the PK-Zip standard.  This means 
you can rename any .smzip file to have the extension '.zip', and then open the 
file in any compression package (e.g. WinZip).

The StepMania Package Manager (smpackage.exe) can also create song packages 
for you.  Simply launch the Package Manager 
(Start Menu->Programs->StepMania->Package Manager), click the song you want to 
create a package for, click the Export button, and a .smzip package will be 
placed on your desktop.


************************************************************

************************************************************
12. The StepMania editor
************************************************************

The StepMania editor allows you to edit, record, synchronize, and play back 
note patterns.  Current, it support saving only in the .SM format.  If you save 
a song that was originally in DWI or BMS format, the old DWI and BMS files will 
be renamed to have ".old" appended to avoid conflicts when the song is next 
loaded.  All of the commands are listed along the left side of the screen.


************************************************************
13. The .SM file format
************************************************************

The .SM song file format was created to be one file format that supports all 
game types that StepMania can play (dance, pump, beat, guitar, etc).  The .SM 
file syntax is identical to DWI except for some different tags and meanings.  
These are a list of all supported tags.

All images can be in png, gif, jpg, or bmp format.  All sounds can be in ogg, 
mp3, or wav format.


#TITLE:...;    - The "main title" of the song.
#SUBTITLE:...; - This text will appear underneath the main title of the song 
on the Select Music screen.  e.g. "-Dirty Mix-", "(remix)".
#ARTIST:...;   - The artist of the song.
#CREDIT:...;   - Give yourself some credit here for creating a wonderful song.
#BPM:...;      - BPM of the music
#BANNER:...;   - The file name of the banner image.  e.g. "b4u-banner.png".  
This image must reside in the song folder.
#BACKGROUND:...;   - The file name of the background image.  e.g. "b4u-bg.png". 
This image must reside in the song folder.
#CDTITLE:...;   - The file name of the spinning CD logo.  e.g. "b4u-cdtitle.png".  
This image must reside in the song folder.
#MOVIEBACKGROUND:...;   - The file name of the a background movie.  e.g. "b4u-movie.avi".  
This movie must reside in the song folder.
#MUSIC:...;   - The file name of the music file.  e.g. "b4u.mp3".  This image 
must reside in the song folder.
#MUSICBYTES:...;   - The size in bytes of the music file that this song was last 
synchronized with.  A "Song may be out of synch" warning will be displayed if 
the value of this tag does not match the actual size of the music file.
#OFFSET:...;   - The time in seconds at which beat 0 occurs in the music.  This 
is specified as a floating point value.  e.g. "2.34".
#SAMPLESTART:...;   - The time in seconds to start the music sample that plays 
on the Select Music screen.  This is specified as a floating point value.  e.g. 
"32.34".
#SAMPLELENGTH:...;   - The time in seconds let the sample music play after 
starting.  This is specified as a floating point value.  e.g. "32.34".  Note 
that in the last 1 second of playing the music will fade out.
#BPMS:...; - A value of the format "beat=bpm".  Indicates that at 'beat', the 
speed of the arrows will change to "bpm".  Both of these values are specified 
as floating point values.  You must specifiy a BPM value for beat 0.  Multiple 
BPMs can be given by separating them with commas.  e.g. "0=160,120=80".  
#STOPS:...;   - A value of the format "beat=sec".  Indicates that at 'beat', 
the motion of the arrows should stop for "sec" seconds.  Both of these values 
are specified as floating point values.  Multiple stops can be given by 
separating them with commas.  e.g. "60=2.23,80=1.12".
#ANIMATIONS:...;   - A value of the format "beat=anim name".  Indicates that at 'beat', 
the background animation should change to the animation names 'anim name'.  'beat'
is a floating point value and 'anim name' is a string.  Different animation change 
are separated by commas.  e.g. "60=falling,80=flower".


Each pattern of steps for different modes have the same basic format:

#NOTES:<NotesType>:<Description>:<DifficultyClass>:<DifficultyMeter>:<RadarValues>:<NoteData>;

NotesType:  Must be one of the currently supported types in StepMania: 
"dance-single", "dance-double", "dance-couple", "dance-solo", "pump-single", 
"pump-double".

Description:  This will be displayed on the gameplay screen.  This can be any 
text, but is most commonly "Basic", "Another", "Trick", "Standard", "SSR", 
"Maniac", "Heavy", or "Challenge".

DifficultyClass:  This value must be "easy", "medium", or "hard".  These values 
correspond the levels of difficulty on the Select Difficulty screen.

DifficultyMeter:  The difficulty of these notes as a bar rating.  The value must 
be an integer between 1 and 10.

RadarValues:  The values that will be displayed on the Groove Radar as floats 
between 0.00 and 1.00.  The 5 values must be separated by commas, and are 
specified in the order: "stream,voltage,air,freeze,chaos".  For MAX300, these 
values are "0.95,0.98,0.22,0.12,0.13".  These values will automatically be 
written when you save the song in the StepMania editor, but you may edit the 
.SM file afterward to tweak them.

NoteData:  This value requires a longer explanation.  The format is pretty 
similar to that used in KSF files.

Each note is represented by a character:

1 = a regular "tap note"
2 = beginning of a "hold note"
3 = end of a "hold note"
a-z,A-z = reserved for game types that have sounds associated with notes

Notes are grouped into rows.  The number of notes in a row depends on the 
NotesType field.

dance-single = 4 notes/row
dance-double = 8 notes/row
dance-couple = 8 notes/row
dance-solo = 6 notes/row
pump-single = 5 notes/row
pump-double = 10 notes/row

For example, a note row for a dance-single pattern may look like "1001" (press 
Left and Right simultaneously.  A note row for a dance-double pattern may look 
like "10010000" (press Left and Right simultaneously on the left pad).

Note rows are grouped into measures.  The number of note rows in a measure will 
determine the time value of each note.  For example, if there are 4 note rows
in a measure, each note will be treated as a quarter note.  If there are 8 notes 
rows in a measure, each note will be treated as a eighth note.  If there are 12 
notes rows in a measure, each note will be treated as a triplet note.  Measures 
are separated by a comma.

Example:

   // measure 1
2010
0000
0100
0000
:  // measure 2
0001
0100
0001
0000
3010
0000
0000
0000
;

************************************************************
14. Background Animations
************************************************************

\BGAnimations\<anim folder>\<layer files>

The BGAnimations folder should contain several folders for individual background animations.  Currently, these background animations cycle in order of their folder names, changing every 4 measures of the song.

In an animation folder, each sprite represents one layer.  Multiple layers can be specified by having multiple sprites.  Layers are drawn from back to front in order of their file name.  Different "layer effects" are specified by adding tokens to the file name.  Here are an explanation of the currently supported tokens:

usesongbg - Use the song's background file instead of this graphics file.  Since this graphics file will not be used, you might want to make this graphic a 1x1 graphic to save space.

add - use additive blending instead of normal blending.

cyclecolor - cycle the color of the layer over the colors of the rainbow

cyclealpha - cycle the alpha channel of the layer over type

startonrandomframe - Start the animation on a random frame.  This is mainly useful for Tile or Particle effects.  

dontanimate - Stay on the first frame of this animation.  This is only useful for layers with multiple frames.

(stretch effects) - These scretch the graphic across the extire screen.
scretchscrollleft,
stretchscrollright,
stretchscrollup,
stretchscrolldown,
       - Scroll the layer in a direction

stretchwater,
stretchbubble,
stretchtwist,
stretchspin,
       - Deform the background sprite with an effect.  Only stretch spin is currently implemented.

(particle effects) - Use the graphic to make individual particles on the screen.
particlesspiralout,
particlesspiralin,
       - Spiral particles away from/toward the center of the screen.
particlesfloatup,
particlesfloatdown,
particlesfloatleft,
particlesfloatright,
       - Scroll the particles across the screen.
particlesbounce,
       - Particles start traveling in random directions and bounce when they hit the edge of the screen.

(tile effects) - Tile the graphics across the screen, forming a grid of graphics.
tilestill,
tilescrollleft,
tilescrollright,
tilescrollup,
tilescrolldown,
       - Scroll the tiles

tileflipx,
tileflipy,
       - Flip the tiles along the X or Y axis.

tilepulse,
       - Tiles zoom in and out.


************************************************************
15. The .CRS File Format
************************************************************

Place holder...

Header section...
#COURSE:...; - name of the course
#LIVES:<0..10>;  - An integer between 0 and 10.  This line is optional.
#REPEAT:<YES|NO>;  - start over after last stage?
#SONG:<group folder>\<song folder>:<description>[:modifiers]; - 
  group folder - The name of the folder that contains the song folder.
  song folder - the name of the folder that contains files for the song
  description - BASIC, TRICK, SSR, MANIAC, HEAVY, etc.
  modifiers - One or more of:
	0.5x, 0.75x, 1.5x, 2.0x, 3.0x, 4.0x, 5.0x, 8.0x
	boost, wave, drunk, dizzy, space, mini
	hidden, sudden, stealth 
	mirror, left, right, shuffle
	little
	reverse
	note, flat, plain
	noholds
	nofreeze
	dark
	norecover, suddendeath, power-drop, death
	0.7xmusic, 0.8xmusic, 0.9xmusic, 1.0xmusic, 1.1xmusic, 
		1.2xmusic, 1.3xmusic, 1.4xmusic, 1.5xmusic


************************************************************
16. Extra Stages
************************************************************

You can manually specify extra stage 1 and 2 by creating a .CRS files in the 
group folder called extra1.crs and extra2.crs.  These courses must contain 
exactly one valid song.  Don't forget to specify modifiers - see the CRS File 
Format section in the readme for more information.  If a CRS file is not found
or is invalid, the program will choose approprite Song/Notes/Options.

************************************************************
17. Creating an Announcer
************************************************************

Announcers folders must reside in the "Announcers" folder inside the 
StepMania program directory (e.g. "Announcers\DDRMAX\").  An announcer folder 
contains several more folders - one for each announcer "trigger".  You can 
place as many .WAV, .MP3, or .OGG sounds as you want in a trigger folder.
When StepMania wants to play a sound for that trigger, it will play a 
random sound file from your trigger folder.

Sound files in a trigger folder can have any name you want.  It's recommended
that you name the sound files according to what is being said (e.g. 
"everybodys waiting for you.mp3").  If there are 0 sound files in a trigger 
folder, or the trigger folder is missing, then no sound will be played for 
that trigger.

************************************************************
18. Creating a Note Skin
************************************************************

Note skins allow you to customize the way notes appear.  Note skins must 
reside in the folder "Skins\(Game Name)\(Note Skin Name)".  Note skins are 
specific to a particular game (dance, pump, etc).  In the note skin folder,
you must implement the folling files for each note:

<NoteName> Receptor (NxN).<png|gif|jpg|bmp>
<NoteName> Note color part (NxN).<png|gif|jpg|bmp>
<NoteName> Note gray part (NxN).<png|gif|jpg|bmp>
<NoteName> Hold Explosion (NxN).<png|gif|jpg|bmp>
<NoteName> Tap Explosion Bright (NxN).<png|gif|jpg|bmp>
<NoteName> Tap Explosion Dim (NxN).<png|gif|jpg|bmp>
<NoteName> Hold.colors
<NoteName> Tap.colors

"<NoteName>" must be the name of the note (e.g. "left", "upright", "snare").
Look at the example note skins included with StepMania for a complete list
for each game.

"NxN" is an optional string that specifies the dimensions of the graphic.  
For example, if there are 6 frames, 3 wide 2 high, in your color part 
animation, then you might use the file name "Up Note color part 3x2.png".

For more information on about graphics loading, see the section "How 
StepMania Loads Textures".

************************************************************
19. Creating a Theme
************************************************************

Themes must reside in the Themes folder in the StepMania program directory.
Inside each theme folder, there are up to three directories: "graphics",
"sounds", and "fonts".

Graphics may be .sprites or any file format described in the section "How 
StepMania Loads Textures".  Sounds can be in .mp3, .ogg, or .wav.  Fonts
must use the .font file format.

When StepMania looks to load a font element (graphic, sound, font), it 
first looks in the current theme folder for the element.  If that element
cannot be found, it will fall back to using the element in the theme named
"default".  "default" is sort of a base theme and should not be modified.

This system allows user-made themes to override as little or as many theme
elements as they want.  For example, you could create a theme that does
nothing more than override the title menu logo.  Such a theme would contain 
only one folder ("Graphics") and one file ("Graphics\title menu logo.png").


> What's in a .font file?

Example:

[Font]
Texture=Score Numbers 7x2.png
Widths=5,8,10,17,15,18,15,6,9,9,8,14,5,9
Characters=01234 :56789~.
CapitalsOnly=0
DrawExtraPercent=0.1

Texure: File name of texture file.  Must be in same directory as .font file.
  Font graphics can be generated by the program Bitmap Font Buider
  (http://www.lmnopc.com/bitmapfontbuilder/).
Width:  The width in pixels of the character in each frame of the texture.
  Characters are specified in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering.
Characters:  The characters corresponding to each frame in the texture.
  Characters are specified in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering.
CapitalsOnly:  0=false, 1=true.  Use "1" if this font implements only 
  capital letters.
DrawExtraPercent:  A number between 0.0 and 1.0 specifying the maximum 
  amount in percentage of the frame width that a character can hang over
  its width.  Many italic fonts hang a actually a little bit wider than 
  base of the characer because of skewing.  For these types of font, the
  DrawExtraPercent should be > 0.  This value takes some playing around with.

20. How StepMania Loads Textures
************************************************************

> What are textures?

"Texture" is simply another name for graphics file.  The name "texture"
is more common when taking about 3D graphics.  This document uses "texture"
and "graphic" interchangably.

> What types of graphics can StepMania read:

StepMania can use any of the following graphics formats as textures:
png, gif, jpg, bmp, avi, mpg, mpeg.  StepMania looks for textures on disk
only by looking at file name minus the extension.  For example, when 
StepMania wants to load the graphic "title menu logo", it will first look
for "title menu logo.png", then "title menu logo.gif", ... then "title 
menu logo.mpeg".


> How to you specify multiple frames in an animation?

Simply add the string "(NxN)".  Immediately before the "." that separates
the main file name and the extension.  For example, suppose there is a file
called "title menu logo.png" that you would like to turn into an animation.
Now, you create an graphic file with 9 frames of animation - 3 frames wide
and 3 frames high.  Name this file, "title menu logo 3x3.png", and stepmania
will play the graphic as an animation with frames in the order left-to-right,
top-to-bottom, with 0.20 seconds separating each frame.

> What are .sprite files?

.sprite files are a way to have even more precise control over how your 
graphics animate.  Each sprite has multiple "states".  For each state, you
may specify: 1) What frame of the graphic to show, and 2) how long to show
this state before moving to the next state.

Let's look at an example .sprite file:

[Sprite]
Texture=dancer p1 8x4.png
Frame0000=0
Delay0000=0.05
Frame0001=1
Delay0001=0.05
Frame0002=2

Texture is the name of the texure file to use.  This must reside in the same
directory as the .sprite file.  If your texture has multiple frames, be sure
to specify the dimensions in the file name using the convention described 
above.

FrameNNNN is the index of the frame number to use for the first state of the
animation.  Frame may range between 0 and (total number of frames - 1).  
Frame indicies move left-to-right, top-to-bottom over the frames in an image.

DelayNNNN is the time in seconds to show the state.


> My graphics show ugly banding or look washed out.  What can I do?

You can use texture hints to have more precise control over how your graphics
are storred on the graphics card.

All are textures loaded by StepMania are 16-bits.  The default the texture 
format is 4444 (4 bits for R,G,B, 4 bits for alpha), which can cause some 
banding artifacts or a washed-out look.  You can change the texture format by 
adding "hints" to the file name.  Hints:

"no alpha" - This will force a 5650 texture format (5 bits for R, 6 for G, 5 
for B, 0 for alpha).  5650 textures cannot have transparency, but have much 
better color fidelity.
"1 alpha" - This will force a 5551 texture format.  If your graphic has only 
"on or off" alpha (like a GIF file), use this hint for better color fidelity.
"dither" - This will dither an image upon load.  Dithering will reduce banding, 
but can cause transparency artifacts.  

Hints can be placed anywhere in the file name, but are usually placed at the 
end of a file name in parenthesis. For example:

caution (dither, no alpha).png
Arrows Left 1x4 (1 alpha).png

> Why do the graphics look so blurry?

Some 3D graphics cards (the Voodoo3 in particular) cannot handles textures > 
256x256.  If a texture is larger than the card's maximum texture size, the 
image will scaled down internally.  Since the card is using a low-resolution 
version internally, the output, when scalled back to the original image size,
will be blurry.

Whenever possible:
* Keep your images to dimensions smaller or equal to 256x256.
* Make your images have an even number for each dimension (e.g. 286x120 is 
will appear less blurr than 285x119).  The reason behind this has to do with
how 3D accelerators represent screen coordinates with floating point numbers,
not integers.

************************************************************
21. Building StepMania from CVS source
************************************************************

CVS is the repository that manages the StepMania source code.  Our CVS server is 
graciously provided by SourceForge.  You can get the absolute-latest bleeding 
edge updates to StepMania by taking the source from CVS.  Below are instructions 
on how to configure your computer to download source code from CVS and complile 
the source into a working executable.

* Step 1: Install and configure Visual C++

The StepMania source can currently be built with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or 
Visual C++ .Net.  Installing Visual C++ or Visual Studio with all the default 
options is sufficient.

* Step 2: Install the Direct X 8.1 SDK

The DirectX 8.1 SDK is a free (but large) download from Microsoft (link here).  
Install it using all the default settings.  The SDK installer will configure 
Visual C++ with the correct paths needed to find the DirectX 8.1 libraries and 
headers.

* Step 3: Install WinCVS

A CVS client is required to "checkout" the course from the CVS server.  Download 
version 1.2 of WinCVS here - http://www.cvsgui.org 
(or http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10072)

IMPORTANT: Now, open and close WinCVS once.  This will cause WinCVS to create 
registry entries, which is required for the next step...

* Step 4: Use SourceForge Setup to install SSH and configure WinCVS

A small utility called SourceForge Setup will greatly simplify the steps needed 
to configure SSH and WinCVS.  Download SourceForge Setup from 
http://sfsetup.sourceforge.net/.  Use the following settings when prompted by SF 
Setup:

- Unpack SSH directory: c:\ssh
- SSH install direcotory: c:\ssh
- Your home directory: c:\ssh
- Your SourceForge user name: -yourusername-
- Name of the project: stepmania
- The directory where you will be keeping checked out project sources: 
c:\stepmania

IMPORTANT: If you are using Windows 2000 or Windows XP SourceForge Setup will 
not correctly write changes to the c:\autoexec.bat file.  Verify that the 
following lines are present after you run SF Setup:

rem SourceForge setup stuff
SET PATH=%PATH%;c:\ssh
SET HOME=c:\ssh

IMPORTANT: You must restart after running SF Setup so that the new environment 
variables take effect.

* Step 5: Enable SSH access to the cvs machine

Before you can use your account, you must type the following (substituting your 
username and projectname as appropriate) before attempting to use CVS from a new 
user account:

ssh -l username cvs.projectname.sf.net

Enter your password, and you'll get a message about how you're not supposed to 
be there and the connection will drop. What they don't tell you is that this 
creates your home directory and is required for things to start working.

* DONE! Enjoy staying on the bleeding edge of StepMania releases!
