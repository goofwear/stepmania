 * I'm undecided about when it's a good idea to use arch; I'm experimenting
 * a bit.
 *
 * This arch driver is simply called at various important points, to let
 * architectures do things.  Windows can use this to start up the crash
 * handler and to output Windows-specific debug information, for example.
 *
 * This class should have one-way data transfer only: functions are called,
 * they may do something, and no data is returned.  (We don't want to have
 * to deal with error handling and so on when using these functions.)
 *
 * This class is constructed at the very start of the program.
