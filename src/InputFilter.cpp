 * button is reported pressed, report it.  If the button is immediately reported
 * released, wait a period before reporting it; if the button is repressed during
 * that time, the release is never reported.
 *
 * The detail is important: if a button is pressed for 1ms and released, we must
 * always report it, even if the debounce period is 10ms, since it might be a coin
 * counter with a very short signal.  The only time we discard events is if a button
 * is pressed, released and then pressed again quickly.
 *
 * This delay in events is ordinarily not noticable, because the we report initial
 * presses and releases immediately.  However, if a real press is ever delayed,
 * this won't cause timing problems, because the event timestamp is preserved.
