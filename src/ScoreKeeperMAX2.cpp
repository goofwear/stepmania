  Note on NONSTOP Mode scoring

  Nonstop mode requires the player to play 4 songs in succession, with the total maximum possible score for the four song set being 100,000,000. This comes from the sum of the four stages' maximum possible scores, which, regardless of song or difficulty is: 

  10,000,000 for the first song
  20,000,000 for the second song
  30,000,000 for the third song
  40,000,000 for the fourth song

  We extend this to work with nonstop courses of any length.

  We also keep track of this scoring type in endless, with 100mil per iteration
  of all songs, though this score isn't actually seen anywhere right now.

  A single step's points are calculated as follows: 
  
  p = score multiplier (Perfect = 10, Great = 5, other = 0)
  N = total number of steps and freeze steps
  S = The sum of all integers from 1 to N (the total number of steps/freeze steps) 
  n = number of the current step or freeze step (varies from 1 to N)
  B = Base value of the song (1,000,000 X the number of feet difficulty) - All edit data is rated as 5 feet
  So, the score for one step is: 
  one_step_score = p * (B/S) * n 
  
  *IMPORTANT* : Double steps (U+L, D+R, etc.) count as two steps instead of one *for your combo count only*, 
  so if you get a double L+R on the 112th step of a song, you score is calculated for only one step, not two, 
  as the combo counter might otherwise imply.  
	
  Now, through simple algebraic manipulation:
  S = 1+...+N = (1+N)*N/2 (1 through N added together) 

  Okay, time for an example.  Suppose we wanted to calculate the step score of a "Great" on the 57th step of 
  a 441 step, 8-foot difficulty song (I'm just making this one up): 
  
  S = (1 + 441)*441 / 2
  = 194,222 / 2
  = 97,461
  StepScore = p * (B/S) * n
  = 5 * (8,000,000 / 97,461) * 57
  = 5 * (82) * 57 (The 82 is rounded down from 82.08411...)
  = 23,370
  
  Remember this is just the score for the step, not the cumulative score up to the 57th step. Also, please note that 
  I am currently checking into rounding errors with the system and if there are any, how they are resolved in the system. 
  
  Note: if you got all Perfect on this song, you would get (p=10)*B, which is 80,000,000. In fact, the maximum possible 
  score for any song is the number of feet difficulty X 10,000,000.
